# Pascal's Triangle

This subfolder contains the solution for the task of generating Pascal's triangle for a given integer `n` using the function `pascal_triangle(n)`.

## Task Description

Write a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascal's triangle of `n`:

- Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`.
- You can assume `n` will always be an integer.

## Solution

The solution for this task is implemented in the following file:

- `solution.py`: Contains the Python code for the `pascal_triangle(n)` function.

## How to Use the Solution

To use the solution and generate Pascal's triangle for a specific value of `n`, follow these steps:

1. Open the `solution.py` file in this subfolder.
2. Copy the code and paste it into your own Python environment or script.
3. Call the `pascal_triangle(n)` function, providing the desired value of `n`.
4. The function will return a list of lists representing Pascal's triangle for the given value of `n`.

Remember to ensure that the `solution.py` file is accessible in your Python environment before using the `pascal_triangle(n)` function.

Please note that this solution assumes `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is less than or equal to zero, the function will return an empty list as specified in the task description.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own projects or requirements.
