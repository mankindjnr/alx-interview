# This tasks handles the validation of single byte UTF-8 validation but the readme discusses validation of multi bit UTF-8 characters. The tasks should be updated to reflect the readme.

## UTF-8 Validation Method

This folder contains the solution for the task of validating if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. The task involves implementing a method in Python that checks whether the provided list of integers forms a valid UTF-8 encoded character set.

## Method Signature

```python
def validUTF8(data):
    """Return True if the 'data' list represents a valid UTF-8 encoding, else return False.

    Args:
        data (List[int]): A list of integers representing 1 byte of data each.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the 'data' is a valid UTF-8 encoding, False otherwise.
    """
```

## Description

A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long. The method `validUTF8` takes a list of integers as input, where each integer represents 1 byte of data. Therefore, it is necessary to handle only the 8 least significant bits of each integer to determine if the data set forms a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Valid UTF-8 Encoding

A valid UTF-8 encoded character follows the following rules:

1. A 1-byte character has the most significant bit set to 0.
2. A 2-byte character has the two most significant bits set to 110.
3. A 3-byte character has the three most significant bits set to 1110.
4. A 4-byte character has the four most significant bits set to 11110.

Additionally, the remaining bytes (if any) of a multi-byte character should start with the two most significant bits set to 10.

## Implementation

The Python method provided in the solution attempts to validate the given 'data' list against the rules mentioned above for a valid UTF-8 encoding. The method returns `True` if the 'data' list represents a valid UTF-8 encoding; otherwise, it returns `False`.

## Example Usage

```python
# Sample usage of the 'validUTF8' method
data_set1 = [197, 130, 1]  # Represents a valid UTF-8 character
data_set2 = [235, 140, 4]  # Represents an invalid UTF-8 character

print(validUTF8(data_set1))  # Output: True
print(validUTF8(data_set2))  # Output: False
```

In this example, the `validUTF8` method is used to check the validity of two data sets: `data_set1` and `data_set2`. The first data set is a valid UTF-8 encoding, and the method returns `True`. The second data set is not a valid UTF-8 encoding, and the method returns `False`.
