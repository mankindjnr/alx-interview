# File Content Operations

This folder contains a solution for a task involving a text file with a single character 'H'. The objective is to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly 'n' 'H' characters in the file. The available operations in the text editor are 'Copy All' and 'Paste'.

## Task Description

Given a number 'n', the task is to implement a method `minOperations(n)` that returns the minimum number of operations required to achieve 'n' 'H' characters in the file. If it is impossible to reach the desired number, the method should return 0.

### Prototype

```python
def minOperations(n):
    """
    Calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly 'n' 'H' characters in the file.

    Args:
        n (int): The desired number of 'H' characters in the file.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of operations required to achieve 'n' 'H' characters. If impossible, returns 0.
    """
```

### Example

```python
n = 9

# Operations:
# H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

minOperations(n)  # Output: 6
```

## Approach

To solve the problem, the method `minOperations(n)` can be implemented using a dynamic programming approach. The general idea is to find the factors of 'n' and determine the minimum number of operations for each factor. By doing so, we can calculate the minimum number of operations for 'n' based on the minimum number of operations for its factors.

The implementation details of the approach are left as an exercise for the developer.
